## Can I submit a mod suggestion?

That depends. If you can answer ALL the below questions with a BIG YES, then sure, go ahead.

1. IS YOUR MOD AVAILABLE FOR 1.7.10?
2. Do you have a link? (preferrably curseforge)
3. Does it fit with the ZoltriTW theme (i.e., Magic not Tech?)
4. Does it add anything meaningful?
5. Is it balanced?
6. Is it something known to cause performance issues on servers?
7. DID YOU SEARCH THROUGH THIS LIST AND MAKE SURE IT WAS NOT PREVIOUSLY SUGGESTED???

For other suggestions: answer whichever questions are applicable (i.e., everything except 1)

# List of potential future mods
[Clay Soldiers](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/clay-soldiers-mod?gameCategorySlug=mc-mods&projectID=227543) - Fun mod, but doesn't add anything crazy, unsure of performance on server, needs further testing  
[Chromaticraft](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/chromaticraft?gameCategorySlug=mc-mods&projectID=235590) - Waiting for updates  
[Wings Horns & Hooves](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/wings-horns-hooves-the-ultimate-unicorn-mod) - looks promising  
[Mailboxes](http://www.9minecraft.net/mailbox-mod/) - adds so little...  
[Archmagus](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/archmagus?gameCategorySlug=mc-mods&projectID=223126) - Need testings  

### Dimension Mods:  
[Erebus](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/the-erebus?gameCategorySlug=mc-mods&projectID=220698) - Biome IDs conflict, and cannot exceed 127 (BOP uses up to 122, and Erebus uses 8), need additional libraries  
[Aether 2](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/the-aether-ii) - potential performance issues, but maybe sometime in the future?  
[TragicMC 2](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/tragicmc2?gameCategorySlug=mc-mods&projectID=74378) - looks really fun, some balance issues
