## Rules and Important Info	

:straight_ruler: Please read these rules carefully, and check back often to see if they've changed: :straight_ruler:  	
> NOTE: I reserve the right to punish rulebreakers AS I SEE FIT. If you have a problem with that, maybe don't play on a public server?

1. Be respectful to everyone, including using selected pronouns! Check tablist or roles on Discord.
2. No griefing! See below for details.
3. No use of third-party software.
4. If something is clearly not meant to happen, report it! Don't exploit it.
5. No discrimination of any kind. This includes slurs. By joining the server you acknowledge that the use of slurs (including but not limited to: r-slur, f-slur, and n-slur) can get you automatically permabanned.
6. You must set your pronouns.
7. You must be over 15 years old.
8. Do not make someone's game unplayable! (see below)
9. Do not repeatedly target a single person with PvP (summoning, killing, cursing, etc.), and
10. You cannot kill someone using the Gorgon head.

Also, in the interest of good sportstime it is strongly discouraged to keep a player's inventory after killing them without reasonable cause.

## Griefing Definition
Someone's base is defined as the area around someone's house or bed that has clearly been built on. Don't make it hard to prove intent to grief!

### Disallowed actions:
- breaking/placing/changing blocks in someone's base
- killing/stealing animals
- stealing items from machines even if they are dropped on the ground
- affecting any function of someone's base

### Allowed actions:
- killing unnamed hostile mobs
- leaving gifts as long as they do not impede any machine or function of their base
- breaking less than 32 (combined) blocks of dirt, stone (not cobblestone) or grass


### Unplayable
What this is:
```
I can't go to my base, but I also can't fix whatever is stopping me from going there.
I get disconnected/lag from what they did near/in my base.
I have been teleported without my permission more than once in 24 hours by the same person/group of people.
```

What this isn't:
```
I don't feel safe (in the Minecraft way) while they are online.
They make me mad by talking in chat (/ignore!)
They stole my hard-to-make gear through legitimate means and now I have to start again.
I haven't actually been teleported without my permission, but they're trying and I'm upset.
```
